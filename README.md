# Task Management System (TMS)

## Description
The Task Management System is a simple web-based application that allows users to *add, mark as completed, and delete tasks* efficiently. All tasks are saved in the browser using *localStorage*, so they persist even after the page is refreshed. This system demonstrates core concepts of web development and software design.

## Features
- Add new tasks to your task list  
- Mark tasks as completed (strike-through effect) 
- Delete tasks individually  
- Tasks are *saved automatically* using localStorage  
- Clean and user-friendly interface  

## How to Use
1. Open index.html in your web browser.  
2. Enter a task in the input box and click *Add*.  
3. Click the *✔ button* to mark a task as completed.  
4. Click the *✖ button* to delete a task.  
5. Refresh the page to confirm tasks are saved and persist.
